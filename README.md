# üïπÔ∏è"Beat'Em'Up" - Summer Game Jam

*"A mysterious robot has landed on Earth on a quest to find monuments and other landmarks. But what is its purpose? Only time will tell..."*

This beat 'em up style game features punching action, breakable containers, loot, and four levels (France, Italy, Eygpt, USA) to discover cultural landmarks.
The game is styled in low-poly 3D with a full-screen pixelation effect, giving a modern take on a classic style and genre.

Future updates may include additional move sets, weapons, particle effects, and a landmark scanning feature (not fully implemented in the current build).
